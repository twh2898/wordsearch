# Word Search

Word search solver takes a matrix of letters and list of words. The solutions
are presented as a pair of x, y positions for the start and end of each word.

## Algorithm

The solver attempts to optimize the search with some pre-processing of the word
list into a letter map. The letter map is a two layer dictionary / map of the
words where the first level is the first letter of each word. The second layer
dictionary is the second letter of each word. The third layer is a list of
all words matching the first and second layer rules.

The algorithm iterates over each letter in the grid, checking if each is in
the first layer of the letter map. If there is a match, a search is performed
on all 9 adjacent letters against the second layer of the letter map. If a
match is found, step through each letter in that direction until a word in the
third layer list is matched.

At this point the algorithm stops the search in this direction. There is an
optional flag to allow the search to continue until the length of the longest
word in the third layer list. This allows for multiple matches of words that
are a subset of the larger word.
